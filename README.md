#Manga Bookstore Program

Program Gist
This program will allow users to store, delete, purchase, list, modify, and sort manga in an inventory. If they decide to store manga, they will be asked the title, author, publisher, volume, price, and quantity. The user will be informed when she/he inputs an invalid valid and will be asked once more.

Troubles
One of difficulties I experiencied is how the users will modify the manga. The program will ask for the title but there could be some manga that have the same title. To resolve this, the program will request for the volume number.
